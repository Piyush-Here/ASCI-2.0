ABOUT PROJECT - Indian artisans are not often not recognised. Even if they do, a year round proper platform is not given.Festivals like toshali promote 
handmade fabrics and many such festivals do give a voice and platform to the artist but its not enough to feed them year round. HastaTanata is an e commerce
platform for the artisans where they can showcase and sell their products.
